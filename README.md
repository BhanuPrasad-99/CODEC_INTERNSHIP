👤 Author
Bhanu Prasad
📌 Project Overview
Employee attrition is a major challenge for organizations, leading to increased recruitment costs, loss of skilled employees, and reduced productivity.
This project focuses on analyzing employee data, identifying key factors influencing attrition, and predicting whether an employee is likely to leave using machine learning techniques.
The project combines data analysis, predictive modeling, and visualization to support data-driven HR decision-making.

🎯 Objectives:
1.Understand patterns and trends in employee attrition
2.dentify factors influencing employee resignation
3.Build machine learning models to predict attrition
4.Evaluate models using industry-standard metrics
5.Provide actionable insights for HR teams

🔑 Key Insights

1.Employees with low income show higher attrition
2.Overtime work significantly increases resignation risk
3.Younger employees are more likely to leave
4.Low job satisfaction is a major driver of attrition

💡 Business Recommendations

1.Improve compensation for early-career employees
2.Reduce excessive overtime
3.Conduct regular engagement and satisfaction surveys
4.Provide career growth opportunities

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn streamlit
python -m streamlit run app.py

📌 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how machine learning can be effectively applied to HR analytics to predict employee attrition and generate meaningful business insights. The solution helps organizations proactively retain talent.


 PROJECT 2

 
📊 Customer Churn Prediction & Analysis

📌 Project Overview

Customer churn refers to customers discontinuing a service. High churn rates directly impact business revenue and growth.
This project aims to analyze customer behavior, identify churn drivers, and predict customer churn using machine learning models.

An interactive dashboard is developed to visualize churn trends and questionnaire-based customer responses.

🎯 Objectives

1.Analyze customer demographics and service usage
2.Identify key factors influencing churn
3.Build predictive churn models
4.Evaluate model performance using classification metrics
5.Provide actionable retention strategies

Random Forest achieved superior performance and was selected as the final model.

🔑 Key Insights

Customers with month-to-month contracts churn more

High monthly charges increase churn probability

Long-tenure customers are more loyal

Lack of technical support leads to higher churn

💡 Business Recommendations

Encourage long-term contracts with incentives

Improve customer support services

Identify high-risk customers early

Provide personalized retention offers

📌 Conclusion

The project successfully demonstrates how predictive analytics can be used to reduce customer churn. The dashboard enables businesses to understand churn behavior and take proactive retention actions.


:::I am a passionate Computer Science Engineering student focused on Data Science, Machine Learning, and Analytics. I have hands-on experience working on internship-level projects involving classification models, data visualization, and business insight generation.
My projects include Employee Attrition Prediction and Customer Churn Analysis, where I transformed raw questionnaire-based datasets into actionable insights using Python, Scikit-learn, and Streamlit. I am eager to apply my analytical and problem-solving skills to real-world challenges and grow as a data professional.
